# Pre-MVP Founder Framework: Comprehensive Evaluation Checklist

## Complete Table-Based Format with Phase 0 First

**Goal:** Evaluate any business idea systematically using structured, scannable tables before building anything.

**Structure:** Phase 0 (Planning & Evaluation) → Phases 1-5 (Execution)

**Time to complete Phase 0:** 2-4 weeks (research + interviews)

---

## THE COMPLETE STARTUP SEQUENCE

```
PHASE 0: PLANNING & EVALUATION (This framework)
├─ Phase 0.1: Market Reality Check (5 questions)
├─ Phase 0.2: Business Model Viability (5 questions)
├─ Phase 0.3: Founder-Problem Fit (3 questions)
├─ Phase 0.4: Execution Readiness (5 questions)
└─ Output: 18 questions answered → GO or NO-GO decision

    ↓ (if GO)

PHASE 1: TECHNICAL VALIDATION (MVT)
├─ Phase 1A: ICP + Architecture
│   └─ "Who is ICP? Does MVT architecture support MVP?"
├─ Phase 1B: POC (Your controlled environment)
│   └─ "Can I build the core thing?"
├─ Phase 1C: Real data validation (1-2 customer systems)
│   └─ "Does it work for real users minimally?"
└─ Output: "This is technically feasible + MVP path clear"

    ↓

PHASE 2: MARKET VALIDATION (RAT = Presale)
├─ Test: "Will they actually pay?"
├─ Method: Presale before full build
└─ Output: 5+ customers prepay

    ↓

PHASE 3: EXECUTION (MVP)
├─ Build + ship to presale cohort
├─ Collect feedback
└─ Output: Customers using it

    ↓

PHASE 4: REFINEMENT (MLP)
├─ Fix feedback, make it lovable
└─ Output: Customers love it, not just tolerate it

    ↓

PHASE 5: SCALE (MMP + Launch)
├─ Polish, document, scale
└─ Output: Ready for public market
```

## Why Phase 0 Matters

**Without Phase 0, you're building in the dark:**

- You: "Let me build this!"
- Reality: Market is already owned by incumbents, no path to profitability, you burn out in 6 months, wasted time

**With Phase 0:**

- You answer 18 hard questions FIRST
- Result: You know if it's worth building before you build it

**Phase 0 Should Filter Out ~80% of Ideas**

Your framework is designed to reject bad ideas early:

- Bad idea #1: "Design tokens monitoring" → Phase 0.1: Market only $5M TAM, incumbents own it → STOP
- Bad idea #2: "Another design tool" → Phase 0.2: Requires 50% COGS, LTV:CAC won't work → STOP
- Bad idea #3: "Hot trending idea I saw on Twitter" → Phase 0.3: I'm not actually interested, just chasing hype → STOP
- Bad idea #4: "Complex enterprise solution" → Phase 0.4: Can't test core assumption quickly → STOP
- Good idea: Passes all 18 questions → NOW go to Phase 1 (MVT)

| **2** | What is the actual market size? (TAM/SOM/SAM)       | Can you reach your revenue target with this market?         | "Everyone could use this" (too broad). "Total market is $10M, we want $500K ARR" (impossible). "I don't know the size."                                            | Clear buyer persona. Market data supports 3-5x revenue target.

| **3** | How concentrated is the market? (Whitespace)        | Is there room for you, or is market owned by incumbents?    | "LottieFiles has 900K installs, but we're better" (market owned). "No competitors, don't know why" (red flag). 47 competitors all <5K installs (fragmented).       | <10K installs in each competitor. No dominant player (largest has 50K). Understand why gap exists.

| **4** | Do you have 10x advantage OR 2x on multiple fronts? | Can you win against existing solutions?                     | "We're 2x better on everything" (nobody is). "No advantage, just work harder" (others will out-resource you). "No competitors, so we'll win" (maybe nobody cares). | 10x on one dimension OR 2x+ on 3+ dimensions. First to market with right solution. Clear distribution advantage.                            | 10x dimension: **_. 2x on: _**. | ⭕ 🟡 ❌ |
| **5** | Can you reach SOM without venture capital?          | Is this bootstrap-able or venture-scale?                    | "Requires 10 massive enterprise deals" (venture-scale). "Average deal $100K+/year" (venture-scale). "Custom integrations + SLA required" (venture-scale).          | Product-led growth path clear. <1-4 month sales cycle. $50-500/mo deal size. 100-500 customers needed, not 10.                              | GTM model: \_\_\_               | ⭕ 🟡 ❌ |

| **6**  | Can you achieve 3%+ conversion (Free → Paid)?                | Will users actually convert to paying customers? | "I expect 10% conversion" (too optimistic). "We don't know conversion target." "Conversion doesn't matter, we'll do enterprise."                                   | 3-5% is realistic based on similar tools. 10+ user interviews: 5+ said they'd pay. Pricing clear, users see ROI quickly.              | Expected conversion: \_\_\_%                       | ⭕ 🟡 ❌ |
| **7**  | What is your unit economics? (LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1)                 | Will you be profitable per customer?             | "COGS is 50%+ of revenue" (margins too thin). "Payback period 18+ months" (takes too long). "Don't know COGS" (figure it out).                                     | 90%+ gross margins. Payback period <6 months. Golden Ratio LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1.                                                             | COGS: **_%. Payback: _** months. LTV:CAC: \_\_\_:1 | ⭕ 🟡 ❌ |
| **8**  | What will cause churn? (Retention < 5%/month)                | Will customers stick around or leave quickly?    | "Not sure what will cause churn" (think about it). "Our product is a one-time fix" (hard to build recurring). "Customers might not need this in 6 months" (risky). | <5% monthly churn realistic. Design systems ongoing = recurring need. <3% monthly churn achievable with execution.                    | Estimated churn: \_\_\_%                           | ⭕ 🟡 ❌ |
| **9**  | What's your go-to-market plan? (GTM without sales team)      | How do customers find you?                       | "We'll do paid ads from day 1" (waste of money). "GTM requires sales team" (not bootstrap-able). "We don't have a GTM plan" (you need one).                        | Clear channel hierarchy (see GTM Channel Ranking below). Organic discovery path clear. <3-6 months to traction.                       | GTM channels: \_\_\_                               | ⭕ 🟡 ❌ |
| **10** | Can you defend against big competitors? (Figma, Anima, etc.) | What if an incumbent builds this?                | "If Figma builds this, we're doomed" (no defensibility). "Haven't thought about this" (you should). "No differentiation if they compete."                          | Clear exit or defensibility plan. Community + data moats. Acquisition target (natural fit). Too narrow for big players to prioritize. | Defensibility strategy: \_\_\_                     | ⭕ 🟡 ❌ |

### GTM Channel Ranking (Question 9 Reference)

**Channel Priority Order for Bootstrap Founders:**

```
TIER 1: HIGHEST SIGNAL (Direct conversations)
├─ Slack/Discord Communities
│   └─ Why: Real-time dialogue, trust signals, warm intros
│   └─ Examples: Design Buddies, Reactiflux, Figma Friends
│
TIER 2: HIGH SIGNAL (Public but engaged)
├─ X (Twitter)
│   └─ Why: Build-in-public works, thought leaders amplify
│   └─ Target: Design Twitter, Dev Twitter, Indie Hackers
│
TIER 3: MODERATE SIGNAL (Searchable, async)
├─ Reddit / Forums
│   └─ Why: Searchable, long-tail discovery, authentic discussions
│   └─ Examples: r/FigmaDesign, r/webdev, r/reactjs, r/SaaS
│
TIER 4: LAUNCH SPIKES (One-time visibility)
├─ Product Hunt / Hacker News
│   └─ Why: Big spike, but one-shot; use for launches
│
TIER 5: MARKETPLACE (Passive discovery)
├─ Figma Community / GitHub
│   └─ Why: SEO-like discovery; users searching for solutions
```

**Why This Order Matters:**

| Tier          | Conversion Quality                   | Effort                       | Feedback Loop         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Slack/Discord | **Highest** - direct trust           | High (relationship building) | Immediate (real-time) |
| X (Twitter)   | **High** - public credibility        | Medium (content creation)    | Fast (hours/days)     |
| Reddit/Forums | **Medium** - anonymous but authentic | Medium (thoughtful posts)    | Slow (days/weeks)     |
| PH/HN         | **Spike** - one-time traffic         | High (launch prep)           | One-shot              |
| Marketplace   | **Variable** - cold discovery        | Low (set and forget)         | Very slow             |

**Tactical Guidance:**

1. **Start with Tier 1**: Join 3-5 relevant Slack/Discord communities. Lurk first, add value, then soft-pitch.
2. **Build on Tier 2**: Post build progress on X. Engage with design/dev thought leaders.
3. **Seed Tier 3**: Answer questions on Reddit. Don't spam—be genuinely helpful.
4. **Plan Tier 4**: Save Product Hunt for post-MVP launch, not validation phase.
5. **Optimize Tier 5**: Ensure your Figma Community/GitHub presence is discoverable.

**Red Flags in GTM:**

- ❌ "We'll run ads" (too early, burns cash)
- ❌ "We'll go viral on TikTok" (wrong audience for B2B dev tools)
- ❌ "We'll cold email" (low conversion, high effort)
- ❌ "We'll sponsor a conference" (too expensive for validation)

**Green Flags in GTM:**

- ✅ Already active in target community Slacks
- ✅ Have Twitter following in target audience
- ✅ Know which subreddits your users frequent
- ✅ Plan to launch on Product Hunt after MVP, not before

## ACTION PLAN: AFTER PHASE 0 GO DECISION

### If Your Score is 16-18: 🟢 GO

**You've validated the idea. Now prove you can build it.**

| Week         | Phase                         | Focus                                        | Deliverable                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Week 0**   | **Phase 1A: ICP + Arch**      | Define ICP, verify MVT → MVP architecture    | ICP documented, architecture continuity confirmed     |
| **Week 1-2** | **Phase 1B: POC**             | Build core functionality in YOUR environment | Working prototype that proves the hard technical part |
| **Week 3**   | **Phase 1C: Real Validation** | Test with 1-2 real users/systems             | "It works for someone other than me"                  |
| **Week 4-5** | **Phase 2: RAT/Presale**      | "Will they pay?"                             | 5+ customers prepay OR strong signal                  |
| **Week 6-10**| **Phase 3: MVP**              | Build for presale cohort                     | Customers using real product                          |

**Phase 1 Success Criteria (MVT):**

- ✅ ICP defined and architecture supports MVP form factor (1A)
- ✅ POC works in your controlled environment (1B)
- ✅ POC works with 1-2 real customer systems (1C)
- ✅ Core technical risk is retired
- ✅ No architecture mismatch between MVT and MVP

**Phase 2 Success Criteria (RAT = Presale):**

- ✅ 5+ customers say "yes, I'll pay $X" with commitment
- ✅ Prepayment OR signed LOI OR deposit collected
- ✅ Clear understanding of what they're paying for

**If MVT fails:** Pivot technical approach or scope down
**If Presale fails:** Pivot positioning, pricing, or entire idea

### If Your Score is 14-15: 🟡 GO WITH CAUTION

| Week       | Focus                      | Goal                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Week 0** | Phase 1A: ICP + Arch       | Define ICP, verify MVT→MVP  |
| **Week 1** | Address weak Phase 0 areas | Fill gaps in validation     |
| **Week 2** | Phase 1B: POC              | Prove technical feasibility |
| **Week 3** | Phase 1C: Real validation  | Test with 1-2 real users    |
| **Week 4** | Go/No-Go checkpoint        | Reassess before presale     |

**Proceed to Phase 2 (Presale) only if:**

- ✅ Weak areas from Phase 0 are addressed
- ✅ MVT successful (Phase 1A + 1B pass)
- ✅ No new red flags emerged

### If Your Score is 11-13: 🟠 YELLOW FLAG

| Action                                             | Timeline |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Identify which Phase 0 sub-section had weak scores | Day 1    |
| Do deeper research/interviews on weak areas        | Week 1-2 |
| Consider if you need a co-founder                  | Parallel |
| Re-score after additional validation               | Week 2-3 |
| Proceed only if scores improve to 14+              | Week 3-4 |

**Do NOT start building until scores improve.**

---

### If Your Score is <11: 🔴 NO GO

| Recommendation                | Action                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Pivot to adjacent problem** | Start Phase 0 fresh with new idea              |
| **Improve founding position** | Get co-founder, more runway, deeper expertise  |
| **Wait**                      | Some ideas need better timing or circumstances |

**Do NOT build. Do NOT pass go. Find a better idea.**

## PHASE 1-5: EXECUTION REFERENCE

### Phase 1: Technical Validation (MVT)

| Sub-Phase | Goal | Success Criteria | Timeline |
| --------- | ---- | ---------------- | -------- |
| **1A: ICP + Architecture** | Define ICP, ensure MVT → MVP continuity | ICP documented, architecture supports MVP form factor | Before building |
| **1B: POC** | Prove core tech works | Works in your controlled environment | 1-2 weeks |
| **1C: Real Validation** | Prove it works for others | Works with 1-2 real customer systems | 1 week |

**Phase 1A Questions:**
- Who exactly is the ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)?
- What form factor is the MVP? (CLI, web app, plugin, etc.)
- Does the MVT architecture support the MVP form factor without rebuild?
- If MVT uses different tech than MVP, is there a shared core?

**Output:** "This is technically feasible. MVP path is clear. No architecture mismatch."

### Phase 2: Market Validation (RAT = Presale)

| Goal             | Method                    | Success Criteria              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "Will they pay?" | Presale before full build | 5+ customers prepay or commit |

**Output:** "People will pay for this. I have customers waiting."

### Phase 3: Execution (MVP)

| Goal                   | Focus                    | Success Criteria            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Ship to presale cohort | Build what they paid for | Customers actively using it |

**Output:** "Customers are using the product. Collecting feedback."

### Phase 4: Refinement (MLP - Minimum Lovable Product)

| Goal            | Focus                   | Success Criteria                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Make it lovable | Fix feedback, polish UX | Customers love it, not just tolerate it |

**Output:** "Customers recommend it to others. Organic growth starting."

### Phase 5: Scale (MMP + Launch)

| Goal                    | Focus                   | Success Criteria                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Ready for public market | Polish, document, scale | Sustainable growth, clear unit economics |

**Output:** "Ready for broader launch. Business is working."
