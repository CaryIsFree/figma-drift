## 🧪 Phase 1C: Closed Beta

Thank you for your interest in Figma Drift! Please note that we are currently in **Phase 1C: Closed Beta**.

### 🚫 Code Contributions (Pull Requests)
At this stage, we are focused on technical validation and core architecture stability. Therefore, **we are NOT accepting code contributions or Pull Requests (PRs)** from the community at this time. 

Any PRs opened will be closed with a reference to this notice. We want to ensure the foundation is solid before opening the codebase to external contributors.

### 🛠️ How You Can Help
While we aren't accepting code, your feedback is invaluable! If you are part of the beta test, please help us by:

1.  **Reporting Bugs**: If you encounter a crash, incorrect diff, or setup issue, please use the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/XeroS/figma-drift/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
2.  **Submitting Validation Reports**: If the tool worked (or failed) for your specific use case, please let us know via the [Validation Report template](https://github.com/XeroS/figma-drift/issues/new?template=validation_report.md).

Structured feedback helps us move faster toward a public MVP. Thank you for being part of the journey!
